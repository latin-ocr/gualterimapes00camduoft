PREFAGE. XV

to understand. In producing the present edition, Ι have had to
contend with many disadvantages3 the practice of the Bodleian
Library, which does not allow its manuscripts to be lent out on any
conditionS, has rendered it impossible for me to collate the text
myself with the original, and it has not always been in my power to
consult, in cases of difficulty, scholars on the spot in whose opinion
I could confide. In the latter portion of the work I have been

intelligible as possible to the general reader. With this principle
in view, Ι have not hesitated to correct the corruptions of the
manuscript, when that correction appeared evident‚ and I have
added a few notes for the purpose of making the text somewhat
