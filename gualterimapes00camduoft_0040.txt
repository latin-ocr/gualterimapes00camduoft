sayS, under the year 1188, “ Eodem anno
Gilebertus Londoniensis episcopus naturae
debitum solvit.” He had previously held
the see of Hereford; and made himself re-
markable in history by constantly sidin g with
the king in his quarrels with Thomas of
Canterbury. However, in a letter among the
Epist. S. Thomae, lib. iii. ep. 5, the abbot
of Ramsey says of him, ‘⁴ Venerabilis
pater noster, Gilbertus Londinensis epis--
copus, vir meritis et nomine conspicuus—
qui saeculari literatura et lege divina ad
unguem institutus, singulis fere tam reli-
gionis quam ecclesiae ordinis et dignitatis
gradus attigisse et conscendisse dignos-
citur.” See Tanner and Godwin. The
book on which Mapes states that he was
occupied in his old age does not appear to
be extant.

²* Bartholomew is said to have been

consecrated bishop of Exeter in 1161, but

there is some uncertainty as to the date of
his death, which has been wrongly fixed in
the year 1 175. The allusion in the text of
Walter Mapes shows that he was still alive
in 1187. Some of his writings are pre-
served. See Tanner.

† Baldwin, so well known as the preacher
of the crusade and patron of Giraldus
Cambrensis, was made bishop of Wor-
cester about 1180, and was afterwards
promoted to the archbishopric of Canter-
bury. According to Tanner he was trans-
lated to Canterbury in 1185, which date
does not agree with that in which Mapes
here speaks of him as still bishop of Wor-
cester. He was a man of considerable
learning, and has left several books.

name as an Anglo-Norman poet, from a
metrical sermon which is still preserved,
in MS. Harl. No. 4388, and in a MS. in
