PREFAGE.

THE work which is now for the first time printed is the most
authentic of all those which have been attributed to Walter MapeS‚
and certainly the most important. It is the book in which this
remarkable man seems to have amused himself with putting down
his own sentiments on the passing events of the day, along with
‘the popular gossip of the courtiers with whom he mixed. It con-
tains almost the only authentic details we have relating to the life
of its author, besides a great mass of historical anecdotes which
are entirely new to us, In fact, the whole book is one mass of
contemporary anecdote, romanoe, and popular legend, interesting Ι
equally by its curiosity and by its novelty.

In my Biographia Britannica Literaria (the Anglo-Norman
Period)‚ I have given a summary of the information with which
Mapes in this treatise furnishes us relating to himself, and I need do
little more than repeat here what I said on that occasion. The cor-
rect form of his name appears to have been Map‚>¹< but as the Latin-
ised form Mapes has obtained a very exten sive degree of popularity,
1 have thought it was perhaps better to retain it. He was a native
of the borders of WaleS, probably of Gloucestershire or Hereford-

* He gives himself this name in the last chapter of his treatise De Nuyis Curiatium,
and it is so spelt in all the most authentic documents.
