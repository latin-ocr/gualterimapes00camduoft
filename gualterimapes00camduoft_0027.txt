De Tityo. vi.*

verumtamen venatores hominum, quibus judicium est datum de
vita vel de morte ferarum, mortiferi, comparatione quorum Minos

nihil in his laetum nec letiferum. Hos Hugo prior Selewude,† jam
electus Lincolniae, reperit repulsos ab ostio thalami regis, quos
ut objurgare vidit insolenter et indigne ferre, miratus ait, “ Qui
vos ?'' Responderunt, “ Forestarii sumuS.'' Ait illis, “ Forestarii
foris stent.’' Quod rex interius audiens‡ risit, et exivit obviam
ei. Cui prior, “Vos tangit haec parabola, quia, pauperibus quos
hii torquent paradisum ingressiS, cum forestariis foris stabitis.³’
Rex autem hoc verbum serium habuit pro ridicule, et ut Salomon
excelsa non abstulit, forestarios non delevit, sed adhuc nunc post
mortem suam sitant coram leviatan carnes hominum et sanguinem
bibunt3 excelsa struunt, quae nisi Dominus in manu forti non de-
struxerit, non auferuntur hii. Dominum sibi praesentem timent

† ΤΒθ priory of Witham in Somerset-
shire, commonly called the Charter-house
in Selwode, was the first house of the
Carthusians in England. It was founded
ΒΥ Henry ΙΙ. ; and St. Hugh, made in 1187
bishop of Lincoln, was the first prior. Gi-
raldus cambrensis, De Vitis Episcoporum
Lincolniensium, e. 26, says that he lived
in great familiarity with the king, who
frequently hunted in Selwood forest in
order to have the opportunity of convers-
ing with him. It was evidently on one of
these visits that the circumstance occurred
which is told in our text. See also on
bishop Hugh, Giraldus Camb. de Vitis Sex
Episcoporum Coaetaneorum, p. 431, and
Godwin de Episcopis.

,ἶ This is a curious instance of the fa·
cility of approach to the royal person in
the reign of Henry ΙΙ. It may be com-
pared with the account which Jordan
Fantosme gives of the arrival of Ranulph de
Glanville‘s messengers from the North,
with intelligence of the capture of the
king of Scotland 3 they penetrate to the
door of the chamber in which the king
was sleeping (it being the middle of the
night) without interruption, and when their
further ingress is there forbidden by the
chamberlain, the king is awakened by their
conversation, and calls the messengers in.
The passage of the metrical chronicler is a
curious picture of the manners of the time.
See the Chronicle of the war between the
English and the Scots, by Jordan Fantosme,
ed. Michel, for the Surtees Soc. p. 90.
