PREFACE. Xi

we have interesting accounts of different sects of heretics which
had sprung up in the twelfth century, and the first Distinction
ends with the story of three remarkable hermitS. The second
Distinction begins with tales relating to pious monks and hermits
and their supposed miracleS, which are followed by some anec-

sketch of the history of the English court from the reign of Wil-

of this division of the work. This sketch of the Anglo-Norman
kings is invaluable.

most of Sir Roger Twysden's papers that are extant, has kindly com—

written by him to his son, then resident in Oxford, which possess
