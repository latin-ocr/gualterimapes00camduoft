De oriyine Cisterciensium. xxiiij.

Cistercienses ’'ss egressi sunt ab Anglia‚ vico qui Scireburna † di-
citur. Ibi nigro militabant habitu sub abbate districto monachi
plurimi 3 quicum eis arctius frena teneret, displicere coepit ali-
quibus, de quorum numero quatuor a fuga non abstinentes Franciam
omnis malitiei matrem petunt, circuierunt, associatis sibi deliciarum
sectatoribUS, quales Francia praecipue semper exibet 3 et in circuitu
suo victualium tandem tenuitatem incurrunt, poenaque penuriae
castigati, quid agendum sit diu deliberant. Reverti nolunt, sine
quaestu vivere nequeunt. Quomodo quaerant quo sit, placet eis
tandem eremum sub praetextu religionis inhabitare, non cum
Pauli vel Hylarionisss eremum in desertis Lybiae vel in inviis
nigrae montanae, non in cavernis et specubus ubi nemo nisi Deus,
sed qui dominum hominem adorare statuunt, homines cum Deo

²* The order of Citeaux, or of the Cis-
tercians, called afterwards White or Grey

not found elsewhere. The facts appear to
be correct ε Stephen, who had the surname

monks, was founded in 1098, by Robert
abbot of St. Michel de Tonnerre. A small
number of monks who had established
themselves in the forest of Colan, near the
abbey just mentioned, in order to live so-
litarily and abstemiously, prevailed upon
him to put himself at their head, and he
led them thence first to the forest of Μο-
lesme, and then to Citeaux, at that time a
wild and solitary spot, five leagues from
Dijon, in the diocese of Chalons.

† Itis well known that Walter Mapes
and his friend Giraldus Cambrensis bore a
great hatred to the Cistercian monks, who
had become the richest order in England.
Mapes has preserved a scandalous story of
the origin of the order, which, I think, is

or patronymic of Harding, and who was
one of the first settlers at Citeaux, and af-
terwards their abbot, was an Englishman,
a monk of Sherburn in Dorsetshire, and
perhaps at least part of his companions
may have been his countrymen. A long
account of him, and the part he took in
the foundation, is given by William of
Malmsbmy, De Gest. Reg. lib. iv. p. 127.
Stephen is said to have been the composer
of the rule of the order. He was elected ’
abbot in 1109.

ss St. Paul the Egyptian was the founder
of the eremitic sect in the deserts of Egypt,
in the third century. St. Hilarion in the
fourth century laid the foundation of the
ascetic establishments in Syria.
