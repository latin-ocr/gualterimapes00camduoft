in what he says of the miracles of Peter archbishop of Tarentaise
and of the monk Gregory of Gloucester.* Mapes is distinguished
by the same love of the popular legends of his country which was
so remarkable in his friend Giraldus CambrensiS.

It is not my intention here to enter into a critical account of
the various works which have been attributed to the pen of Walter
MapeS. The work now first published is unfortunately preserved
in only one manuscript (in the Bodleian Library at Oxford),† and

king Herla, of the Cluniae monk who quitted his monastery to
re-embark in worldly atsaiw, and of Edric the Wild‚) but from the
indications of several different dates as the period of composing
different portions of the work. It appears from the l5th chapter
of the first Distinction‚ that the author was writing that part of
the book when the news arrived of the capture of Jerusalem by
Saladin, which must therefore have been the latter part of the year

yet at the beginning of the same Distinction he says that he is
