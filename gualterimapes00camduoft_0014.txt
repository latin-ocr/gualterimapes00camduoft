writing on St. Barnabas's Day (the llth of June), the same day
on which the young king Henry died in 1182, evidently looking
back to that event as being some time past3 and in the sixth
chapter of the fifth Distinction he speaks in one place of the death
of king Henry IL, which occurred in 1189, a little after which he
alludes to events which occurred when Richard Ι. and Philip of
