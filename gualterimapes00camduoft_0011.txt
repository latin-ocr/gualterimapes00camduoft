the court of Louis le J eune, king of France, with whom he lived
a short time on intimate terms 3 and soon after this he was sent
by the English king to attend the council which had been called
by pope Alexander ΙΙΙ. at Rome, and in his way was hospitably
entertained at the court of Henry the Liberal, count of Champagnef'ss
At this council Mapes was held in so much consideration that he
was deputed to examine and argue with those deputies of the
then rising sect of the WaldenseS, who had been sent to Rome to
obtain the papal authority for preaching and reading the Scriptures
in the vernacular tongue.† This council was probably the Lateran
council held in the year 1 1 79. His information relating to the unfor-
tunate Waldenses is not the least interesting chapter in the book.

Walter Mapes informs us that he was the personal enemy of
the king's illegitimate son Geoffrey, afterwards archbishop of
York, but that his own great influence with his sovereign shielded
him from his resentment3 Mapes had resisted several of Geoffrey's
acts of extortion and injustice, and had answered his threats with
cutting sneerS. When GeOffrey was elected to the see of Lincoln,
about the year 1176, Mapes was appointed to succeed him as

canon of St. Paul's,‡ and with this appointment he also held that
of precentor of Lincoln.§ He likewise held many other smaller

ecclesiastical preferments‚ among which was the parsonage of
Westbury in Gloucestershire. ΙΙ
