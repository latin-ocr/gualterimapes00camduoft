meritis nos a fluctibus indemnes eriperet, et in medio procellae
conquievi modicum, et ecce vidi dominum Gregorium per singulos
nautas incedentem, animantem eos et docentem, et singula corri-
gebat. Excitatus igitur omnia reperi summa tranquillitate, silentia
meritas Domino persolvi gratias. Hoc de ipso postmodum ab-
bati suo Hamelino³¹< retuli, quod ipse cum multa gratiarum actione
multis intimavit. Hoc autem Gillebertus de Laci,† vir illustriS‚
qui se templo donaverat, audienS, exemplo mei cum praedicti Gre-
gorii precibus et benedictione J erosolimam petiit, et in mari Graeco
similiter ipsi contigisse postmodum narravit.
De beato Petro Tarentasioe. iii.
Vidi postmodum beatum Petrum archipraesulem Tharentha-
siae,‡ qui montes inter Alpinos residet, virum tantae virtutis et tot
illustrem miraculis, ut meritis antiquorum quos in ecclesia coli-
mus patrum aequalis possit justissime praedicari, cujus manu Do-
minus solo tactu et prece curabat infirmOS, daemonia effugabat,
nec attemptavit quod non perficeret. Hic per dies undecim cum

* Hamelinus was abbot of Gloucester
from the 26th of September, 1148, to the
loth of March, 1179.

† This was the first Gilbert de Lacy,
the partizan of the empress Matilda in
the civil wars of the reign of Stephen.
He afterwards became a templar, and the
date of his death appears to be uncertain.

1 Peter, who for his ascetic piety was
canonized by the church of Rome, and
who was universally believed to have had
the power of working miracles, was arch-
bishop of Tarentaise from 1141 to his
death in 1174. In 1173 he was commis-
sioned by pope Alexander 111. to attempt
a reconciliation between Henry 11. and

Louis VII. of France, who were then at
war, and he is said to have performed
many miracles before the two monarchs.
See Gallia Christiana, vol. xii. col. 706.
We learn from Hoveden, Annal. p. 532,
that at the beginning of this year the
archbishop of Tarentaise was present at
the espousals of prince John (Henry’s
younger son) with Aalis daughter of the
count of Maurienne3 and, as the English
king went to Auvergne for this purpose, it
is probable that he was accompanied on
this journey by Walter Mapes, and that
they made a brief stay at Limoges, as nar-
rated in the text.
