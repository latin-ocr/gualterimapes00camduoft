De sene Aoeacessi. xxii.

Contigit item quod vir auctoritatis maximae, qui senex vocatur
Axasessis,* quasi sub axe consessis imperat, qui fuit fons reli-
gionis et fidei gentilium, a patriarcha J erosolimitano peteret
librum evangeliorum, quo etiam eorum interpretem misit.
Acceptus est interpres et evangelium affectuose susceptum,
missusque vir ex ipsis bonus et magnuS, ut a patriarcha sacer·—
dotes et levitas a quibus baptismum et fidei sacramenta plene
perciperent secum reduceret, quem obiter positis insidiis inter-
fecerunt oppidani templarii, ut aiunt, ne fides evacueretur infidelium
ad pacis unitatem. Sunt enim, ut aiunt, Axasessi primi paga-
norum infidelitatis et incredentiae magistri. Senex a fraude com-
perta priorem compescuit freno diaboli devotionem, siluitque Domi-
nus facere quod spopondisse videbatur. Patriarcha dolere potuit, et
rex, ulcisci neuter 3 patriarcha non potuit, quia Roma captivitatem
educit bursae et cunctis locis3 rex non, quia minimus eorum digitus
major est illo. J ocelinus Saresberiensis† episcopUS, filio suo Re-
ginaldo Batoniensi, per violentiam electo, sed ad consecrationem
a Cantuariense non admisso, plangentique, respondit, ‘⁶ Stulte,
velox ad Papam evola, securus nihil haesitanS, ipsique bursa grandi
paca bonam alapam, et vacillabit quocunque volueriS.'' Ivit erg0,

*ι The best work on the history of the
sect of the Assassins is that of the baron
von Hammer-Purgstall, which has been
translated into French and English. The
medieval Christian writers, mistaking the
meaning of the title of the chief of this
sect, always represent him as an old man
(senex). The story here told will be
found much more detailed in the History
of William of Tyre, lib. XX, cc. 31 et seq.
p. 994, ed. Bongars.

† J ocelin was a native of Lombardy,and

died in 1184. The date of his election to
the bishopric of Salisbury is uncertain.
His son Reginald was bishop of Bath and
Wells from 1174 to 1191, after which he
was for a very brief period archbishop of
Canterbury. The archbishop of Canter-
bury appears to have refused to confirm
himin his bishopric, because he was too
young (only 24 years of age, according to
some), and he probably accompanied him
to Rome, for he subsequently consecrated
him at San Giovanni in Savoy.
